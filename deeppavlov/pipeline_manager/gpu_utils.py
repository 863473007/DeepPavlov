    Considers all available to the user graphics cards. And selects as available only those that meet the memory
    criterion. If the memory of a video card is occupied by more than "X" percent, then the video card is considered
    inaccessible. For the value of the parameter "X" is responsible "gpu_fraction" argument.

    Args:
        num_gpus : int; How many gpus you need (optional)
        gpu_select : iterable; A single int or an iterable of ints indicating gpu numbers to search through.
         If left blank, will search through all gpus.
        gpu_fraction : float; The fractional of a gpu memory that must be free for the script to see the gpu as free.
         Defaults to 1. Useful if someone has grabbed a tiny amount of memory on a gpu but isn't using it.
